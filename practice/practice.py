# ===========================
# 1. Variables Practice
# ===========================
# Problem: Assign two numbers to variables and print their sum.
num1 = 5
num2 = 10
# Write the code here: Print the sum of num1 and num2.

# ===========================
# 2. Datatypes Practice
# ===========================
# Problem: Assign various datatypes to variables and print their types.
var_int = 42
var_float = 3.14
var_str = "Hello, Python!"
var_bool = True

# Write the code here: Print the type of each variable.

# ===========================
# 3. Type Casting Practice
# ===========================
# Problem: Take two numbers as input, cast them to integers, and add them together.
num_str1 = input("Enter the first number: ")
num_str2 = input("Enter the second number: ")
# Write the code here: Cast num_str1 and num_str2 to integers and print their sum.

# ===========================
# 4. Comparison Operators Practice
# ===========================
# Problem: Take two numbers as input and compare them.
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
# Write the code here: Compare num1 and num2 and print:
# "num1 is greater" if num1 is greater,
# "num2 is greater" if num2 is greater,
# "Both numbers are equal" if they are equal.

# ===========================
# 5. Logical Operators Practice
# ===========================
# Problem: Take two numbers as input and print "Both numbers are even" if both are even.
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
# Write the code here: Check if both num1 and num2 are even using a logical operator and print the message if both are even.

# ===========================
# 6. List Practice
# ===========================
# Problem: Take five numbers as input and store them in a list, then print the list.
num_list = []
# Unknown Code here, Will learn Loop
for i in range(5):
    num = int(input(f"Enter number {i+1}: "))
    num_list.append(num)

# Write the code here: Print all numbers stored in the list.

# ===========================
# 7. Conditionals Practice
# ===========================
# Problem: Check if a given number is odd or even.
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# Write the code here: Print "Odd" if the number is odd, and "Even" if the number is even.
